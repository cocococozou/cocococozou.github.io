####Background

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease(NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic steatosis in the absence of a history of significant alcohol use  or other known liver disease.  Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the progressive form of NAFLD. 

The Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease Activity Score (NAS) is commonly used in therapeutic trials to evaluate changes in Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). 


###Research Question

To investigate the interobserver reproducibility of the NAS score, and the variation between final diagnosis and NAS score, among subspecialist liver-GI pathologists at a single academic medical center.
